##  Problem Statement

Traditional learning often overwhelms conscious focus and leads to distraction. Our solution taps into subconscious processing by subtly delivering content that aligns with a userâ€™s mood and cognitive rhythm â€” improving both attention and retention over time.

## Use of AI/LLM 
We use LLMs or AI summarizers to convert chapters/topics into key points.

These are shown on flashcards using structured layouts and spaced repetition logic for subconscious retention.

Optional Discord integration supports reminders and ambient exposure to content.
